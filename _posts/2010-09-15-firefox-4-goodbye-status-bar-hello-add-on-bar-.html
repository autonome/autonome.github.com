<p>One of the biggest changes in Firefox 4 is the overhaul of the default user interface, with a primary goal of putting the focus on Web content, and getting the browser out of the way. One component of that goal is the removal of the status bar, and the transition of it's features to the navigational area of the browser. This change, if all goes well, should be in the next beta of Firefox 4.</p>
<p>However, the status bar is home to a *lot* of add-ons. The bar is below Web content, and outside of the focal area of web content and browser navigation, which makes it a decent location for passive reception of non-interactive data such as weather, stock tickers and world clocks. Many add-ons put status icons there, and buttons that open configuration panels.</p>
<p>A downside of the current implementation of the status bar is that it's not customizable like toolbars are. For example, a user can't temporarily remove a button from the status bar while keeping the add-on installed. They can't change the position or order of the items in the status bar. The can't move a status bar item into the navigation or bookmarks bar if they prefer that location instead.</p>
