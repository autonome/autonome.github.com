<p>This software cocktail cooled my MacBook Pro by more than 40 degrees Fahrenheit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="http://shockwidgets.com/ministat2update1.8.htm">MiniStat2 Dashboard widget</a>. It shows CPU temperature as well as fan speed. This allows you to do easy before/after verification.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/">SleepWatcher,</a> which executes commands at wake/sleep events.</li>
<li>Finally, install <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/a1291762/2006/10/changing-fan-speed-to-beat-heat.html">FanSpeed</a>, which increases the minimum fan speed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before: 132F<br />
After: 84F</p>
<p>There are downsides (noticeable fan sound, uses more power), but having a laptop that I can have in my lap is well worth it.</p>
