<p>We're at the end of our Performance work-week here in Brussels, and gearing up for a two-day orgy of European open-source culture at FOSDEM. I've successfully acquired a cold (and hopefully not worse) due to the temperature being <a href="http://j.mp/xUY8FQ" target="_blank">consistently below freezing</a>.</p>
<p>However, the people here in Brussels have made up for their weather shortcomings by welcoming us wherever we go. Between the hackerspaces and co-working spaces, and the restaurants that happily take large groups with little or no notice, I'm very impressed!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://hackerspace.be/">hackerspace in Brussels</a> is located in Schaerbeek, a neighborhood to the north of the city center. The space used to be a vehicle repair garage for the city, but was given up for use by the geeks. They've installed <a title="oscillosock!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800517943/in/photostream" target="_blank">serious hardware</a>, and have fully-equipped the place with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800515533/in/photostream">everything needed for survival</a>. Thanks to Rafael and Patrick, for answering all our questions and helping us make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29" target="_blank">mate</a> and to find food nearby. Lunch on the second day was described by Patrick as a "little French place", but turned out to be a hall of worship dedicated to Tintin!</p>

<p>Faubourg St Antoine is filled with Tintin toys, art and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800526217/in/photostream/" target="_blank">knick-knacks</a>, including some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800525605/in/photostream/" target="_blank">alternate</a> interpretations and even a clarification for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800523647/in/photostream" target="_blank">something I'd always wondered about</a>. Sadly, they've been issued a legal notice from the current copyright (or EU equivalent) holders requiring them to remove all the Tintin materials from public display :(</p>

<p>Once the temperatures dropped far below freezing, we relocated to <a href="http://coworking.betagroup.be/" target="_blank">BetaGroup Coworking Brussels</a> in Etterbeek, to the southeast of the center. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ramonsuarez" target="_blank">Ramon Suarez</a>, the manager of the space was very accommodating, taking us on short notice. The wi-fi was blazing fast, the coffee was hot, and the ping-pong was a welcome break from heads-down hackery. The space itself was fantastic, with a great combination of quiet co-working areas, public spaces and private meeting offices. With tons of natural light, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800566217/in/set-72157629096248615">steel bridges</a> and a meeting space on what looked like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6800567379/in/set-72157629096248615">a submarine conning tower</a>, it was truly impressive.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful lunch at a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/6811646793/in/set-72157629096248615">very tidy restaurant</a> nearby.</p>
<p>Overall, it's been a fun and productive week, if a bit chilly. Like, really chilly. Ridiculously so. Why do people even inhabit places that get this cold? Honestly, wtf.</p>
