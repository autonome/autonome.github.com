<blockquote><a href="http://www.weatherwars.info/Katrina.htm">"Japanese Yakuza crews who leased large strategic Russian scalar interferometers from the KGB in latter 1989 ... have been engineering the weather over North America initially (and in some other places) since then, and have since become the most skilled interferometer operators on the planet.  They are also being used as direct protégées by the KGB/FSB, which has moved them into the final Operations Phase of the long asymmetric war against the United States.
