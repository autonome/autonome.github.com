<p>I've been focusing more on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack">Jetpack</a> development this quarter, but will still be posting performance round-ups regularly here. In fact, here's one now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taras Glek continues to blog his progress on improving the binaries we ship, talking about <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2010/04/05/linux-how-to-make-startup-suck-less-and-reduce-memory-usage/">how reordering binaries improves memory use as well as load time</a>, <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2010/04/12/squeezing-every-last-bit-of-performance-out-of-the-linux-toolchain/">leveraging GCC's PGO for fast startup</a>, and finally about <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2010/04/07/icegrind-valgrind-plugin-for-optimizing-cold-startup/">Icegrind, his Valgrind plugin</a> that generates a log of the order of access to mmap'd files.</li>
<li>Are we fast yet?! The answer to that question, at least in regards to JavaScript performance test suites, can be found at <a href="http://arewefastyet.com/">AreWeFastYet.com</a>, where you'll see graphs that show Firefox trunk's performance relative to Google's V8 and Apple's Nitro on the Sunspider and V8Bench tests. I won't spoil the answer for you, you'll have to go check it out for yourself.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=557552">finished and checked-in</a> my changes to the <a href="http://tests.themasta.com/tinderboxpushlog/?tree=Firefox">Tinderbox Pushlog</a>, adding a new feature that provides at-a-glance comparison in performance test results between any two pushes on the page (<a href="https://bug557552.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=437335">screenshot</a>). It will go live next time Marcus pushes changes out to his server. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">But he's not online at the moment, so I don't know when this feature will go live.</span> Heh, it went live moments after I published this post.</li>
<li>Heather Arthur and Clint Talbert are working on a project to add performance data to Addons.mozilla.org for extensions. They're starting with the effect of a given extension on Firefox startup time. Follow along on the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=559929">bug</a>, or <a href="http://github.com/harthur/dirtyharry">watch project Dirty Harry on Github</a>.</li>
<li>Improving the AMO extension validator: AMO scans uploaded extensions and reports problems to the authors. For performance best-practices, we should at least warn the authors if possible if their add-on is doing something that'll make Firefox slow. This bug is for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=551714">warning about add-ons that don't have their content in a JAR file</a>. If you see any thing in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Addons/BestPractices">best practices guide</a> that can be statically detected, please file a bug for it <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=addons.mozilla.org&amp;component=Admin%2fEditor%20Tools">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any other performance-related bugs, blog posts, anecdotes or other tomfoolery, post it in the comments!</p>
