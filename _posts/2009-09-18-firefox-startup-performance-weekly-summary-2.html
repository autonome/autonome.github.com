<p>Apologies for not posting last week, but <a href="http://dietrich.tumblr.com/post/189638511/atp-was-so-much-damn-fun">I was on vacation</a>. Recent activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've updated the project wiki page with <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Startup_Time_Improvements#Overview">a table of summarized numbers</a> for at-a-glance tracking of progress. I need to disable superfetch and try again on Windows.</li>
<li>Our measurements of cold startup showed a huge regression on Windows from 3.5 to 3.6. Tracking this in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517741">bug 517741</a>.</li>
<li>JARification: David abandoned <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509755">moving JS  modules into a JAR file</a>, since those files are fastloaded. However, since we want things like post-extension-install restarts to be fast, and those cause fastload cache invalidation, we might want to do things like this anyways. I filed a bug for the same treatment for components. These are lower priority, since they're not the normal startup case. Follow along with all JAR-ification via<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513027"> the tracker  bug</a>.</li>
<li>JAR Performance: I'm going to test-land <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510844">bug 510844</a> on the Places branch to figure out what's going wrong on the tinderbox. It should increase throughput of JAR file reading, possibly affecting Ts and Tp.</li>
<li>Removing the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512827">needless stats of already-fastloaded components</a> is being looked at more broadly in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511761">bug 511761</a> by Ben Hsieh with help from Taras and others. There are a bunch of dirty ways to trigger component re-registration and fastload cache invalidation, so I filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517515">bug 517515</a> to consolidate these in an explicit manner.</li>
<li>Cold Startup Testing: Drew and Alice made a bunch of progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510587">bug 510587</a>,  to create a new Ts that measures cold startup. Alice is working on mobile Talos though, so this is sidelined for a bit. The only issue left is reliable Windows measurement, but we're not going to block on it, can live with Mac and Linux to start off.</li>
<li>Preference Files: Taras Glek has been working on combining the different preference files into a single one at build time, in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507288">bug 507288</a>. The patch is there, and is just trying to find a way to land cleanly.</li>
<li>Service Caching: Vlad, Drew and Taras are working on caching some services globally for C++ code. For example, 50% of the GetService calls for the IO service originate from NS_NewURI usage. This work is in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=516085">bug 516085</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects in a holding pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup Timeline: No updates, still not landed. Add [ft] in the whiteboard of your bug w/ the function names you want timed and David will generate it and update the bug.</li>
<li>PGO for Places, mozStorage and SQLite: Still blocking on Rel-Eng fixing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=486783">bug 486783</a>, which now has patches!</li>
<li>Static Analysis: No progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128">bug 506128</a>.  David needs to file a bug with the final log of named-yet-uncalled  functions.</li>
<li>Dirty Profile Testing: No progress. Need to list scenarios, file bugs  for each, generate Talos config patches and profile data, and then move  it into Rel-Eng territory. Also, need to get a separate Tinderbox tree,  since it’s going to cause a bazillion new columns.</li>
<li><a href="http://wagerlabs.com/">Joel Reymont</a> noted in<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513076"> bug 513076</a> that there are serious drawbacks to getting our libraries in the dyld  shared cache on Mac, so has deprioritized that work.</li>
<li><a href="http://screwedbydesign.com/blog/2009/09/this-week-in-perf-sep04.php">Ryan  Flint blogged about</a> various front-end improvements he’s working on  that affect startup time.</li>
<li>CSS Parsing Time: Zack says his work in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513149">bug 513149</a> might improve CSS parsing time by 50%, and it’s next on his list.</li>
</ul>
