<p>I don't have wrist/hand/finger problems... yet. As a developer, I've always seen these problems not as an "if", but a "when" thing. From the article:<br />
"A study led by Marianne Garfinkel, Ed.D., a faculty lecturer at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia and a yoga practitioner, has given credence to the idea that certain asanas can facilitate wrist rejuvenation."<a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/health/128_1.cfm">Link</a></p>
