<p>Today, I hosted a workshop on bookmarks, tagging and history for <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Support+Firefox+Day">Firefox Support Day</a>! If was pretty fun, and very different from the development grind of late. Some thoughts about the experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've had my head in the Firefox 3 sand for a *long* time. Trying.. to remember.. how to.. talk..</li>
<li>SUMO is *fantastic*. I had no idea what it was until today... and I am ashamed for that.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.djst.org/blog/">David Tenser</a> is truly a gentleman.</li>
<li>Live screen-sharing with audio... worldwide... free... on the web, is a PAIN. We did not accomplish this, and resorted to a phone conference for audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's nice to be out in society again. Who knows, maybe I'll even blog more.</p>
