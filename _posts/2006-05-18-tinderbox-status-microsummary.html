<p>The point at which I regressed browser startup time in the Firefox 2 Alpha 2 was about the same point at which I started keeping a very keen eye on <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org">Tinderbox</a>. Thus, a Tinderbox status Microsummary! <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries">Microsummaries</a> are a hot new feature in Firefox 2 - basically a bookmark with a label that periodically updates. This Tinderbox Microsummary will show "OK" or "{#} Burning ({hostnames})" for the tree that you bookmark. Support for orange trees is not there yet.</p>
<p>You can install it <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/tinderbox-microsummary.xml">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, here's a snippet of <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/microsummary.xsl">XSL</a> for allowing your generators to display themselves, as they traipse about the internets.</p>
