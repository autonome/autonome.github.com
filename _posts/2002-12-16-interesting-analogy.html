<p>"That's where my analogy came in. In traditional IT projects, I said, ROI has been as elusive as high-school sex: "The question was always, are you going to get any?" But with web services, ROI is more like married sex: "You know you're getting it, but you're always wondering, what can we do to make it better?"<a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_12_08_lc.htm#90053215">Link</a></p>
