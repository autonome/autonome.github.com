<p>The <a href="http://j.mp/mu7vZc">Firefox Add-on SDK is now 1.0</a>! It's got a set of APIs that allow you to build basic restart-less add-ons without needing to know anything but JavaScript.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://j.mp/iq6fus">core set of APIs</a> is clearly not complete. There are no APIs for creating or searching bookmarks nor for building sidebars or menus. There's a whole host of things you can do in XUL add-ons that the SDK doesn't yet have nice and clean JavaScript APIs for.</p>
<p>And I hope it never will.</p>
<p>BECAUSE... I think that the best way to both keep the SDK slim-and-trim *and* massively grow the feature set is for add-on developers to publish and share their modules, similar to how has been done in the Node community with NPM.</p>
<p>The Add-on SDK team will always be pushing things forward - adding infrastructural improvements, support for new Firefox features, fixing bugs and improving resource efficiency and performance. And this work is often higher priority than adding the API that you might need for your add-on.</p>
<p>So if you write a module for your add-on, and you think others might be interested in using it, please list it on the <a href="http://j.mp/aDar20">Jetpack Modules</a> page. Maybe eventually there'll be a cool package manager for these modules, or maybe NPM itself could be adapted to use the <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/search/library/">Add-on Builder's repository of library packages</a>.</p>
<p>Creating a module is easy. It's a JavaScript file that uses the <a href="http://www.commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a> format for defining public APIs.</p>
<p>Example module in a file utils.js:</p>
<pre>exports.helper = function helper() {
Â  // do stuff
}</pre>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre>require('utils').helper();</pre>
<p>And that's it. Check out the <a href="http://j.mp/aDar20">modules page</a> for a bunch of examples that you can use in your add-ons. Some modules to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/erikvold/toolbarbutton-jplib">Toolbar button</a> module by Erik Vold.</li>
<li><a href="http://j.mp/lHnXy2">Brain</a>, by Heather Arthur, provides APIs for creating neural networks and naive Bayesian classifiers.</li>
<li><a href="http://j.mp/ifQZFp">My module</a> for providing your own suggestions in the Firefox location bar.</li>
</ul>
