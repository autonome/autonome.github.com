<p>Here in the Northwest the rainy season is upon us. So, the other day I searched <a href="http://portland.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> and hired someone to clean out the gutters and pressure-wash the roof of our house. They showed up today, and while chatting with them I mentioned that I work on Firefox. Not only had both of these guys heard of Firefox, but they got excited and said that it's their default browser.</p>
<p>Of course, I immediately used the opportunity to do that which is the point of this blog post: Plug Firefox 2.0 :)</p>
<ul>
<li>New theme</li>
<li>Anti-phishing</li>
<li>Microsummaries</li>
<li>Spell-check</li>
<li>Session-restore</li>
<li>Undo-close-tab</li>
<li>Search suggestions</li>
<li>Feed handling</li>
<li>And 23 other enhancements and bug-fixes (give or take a few thousand)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Download Firefox 2.0</a></p>
<p>Enjoy :)</p>
