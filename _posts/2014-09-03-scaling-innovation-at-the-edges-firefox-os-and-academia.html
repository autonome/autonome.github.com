<p>A couple of months ago I wrote about some work I've been doing with Firefox OS and academic programs. The response was pretty good. I received a few emails, had a few IRC conversations, even talked to some people in person, and as a result...</p>
<p><strong>I may have more than a thousand people who can contribute to Mozilla.</strong></p>
<p>One blog post. One thousand new contributors.</p>
<p>I could have spent that time fixing Firefox OS bugs, or improving spreadsheets and dashboards. But that would have the impact of only one person, and that just isn't enough. If Mozilla hired 40,000 more employees, we'd still be smaller than Google, Apple and Microsoft. If we had a billion dollars, that would be around <strong>1/60th</strong> of Google's <strong>annual</strong> revenue, which is less than both Apple and Microsoft. So yeah, at Mozilla we have to do things differently.</p>
<p>So say it all works out and we've got 1000 people. There are challenges, however.</p>
<p>Students are not employees. They have variable time to work on the project, they're not professionals (yet), and they can only work on things that align with their program and area of study.</p>
<p>A casual contributor can be a drag on the process. Due to the inherently casual nature of volunteer contributor involvement, they are often not interested in the type of work involved in shipping Firefox OS to carrier/operator/OEM customers, nor the time commitment required to do so.</p>
<p>Firefox OS is less amenable to volunteer contribution than a typical open source project. The competing goals of certification-level quality, market-specific features, and the ongoing turbo-charging of the Web platform have resulted in development cycles that are fast, deadlines that are hard, and a road map of non-negotiable catch-up features for some time to come. We've managed to build some fantastic and innovative features, but there's still so much to do for parity with the competition - the pace is still too slow, too fraught with complexity and competing demands on our limited resources.</p>
<p>We need to make larger leaps forward. We need to radically grow Firefox OS as a product and a platform, grow a community of innovators around it, and relieve some of the pressure on the core development team.</p>
<p>Here are the core pieces of how we can use academic programs both grow Mozilla and accelerate Firefox OS without creating drag on the product release schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify graduate-level programs which have a focus in areas of interest to us, and build research partnerships.</li>
<li>Focus on the 1-3Â  year road map features, and research/experimentation. Ignore near-term goals.</li>
<li>Use undergraduate programs to flesh out designs, build prototypes and experiment broadly.</li>
<li>Only work with programs where students get academic credit for their contributions, ensuring motivated contributors, and an equitable exchange of value.</li>
<li>Work outside of the Mozilla development process, letting students do the work where they're most comfortable. The goal is explicitly not to "land" their contributions directly in our products.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I do think this work will accelerate Firefox OS development generally, these types of programs and relationships are important for Mozilla when considering what will make it a fifty to a hundred year organization. Not only do these programs help move the mission forward in both the product delivery and innovation areas now, but it builds relationships that lay the groundwork for future interactions: recruiting, volunteer contributors, business relationships and at a technical level it exposes the power of web platform to the makers of tomorrow. The educational aspect alone may have a long-term impact: I've had conversations with people that rally around the open web, decry software monocultures and yet don't really understand the mechanics behind Mozilla's role in keeping the Web open. Working directly with students gives us a chance to make that clear at an early stage.</p>
<p>Chris Beard, Mozilla's new CEO, said something recently which every CEO of Mozilla has probably said at one point or another, but can't be repeated enough: "We are not like any of our competitors." It's very easy to fall into the trap of traditional software development - emailing off the list, closed meetings, shutting out feedback. Mozilla cannot scale that way, and likely wouldn't survive if we tried. We need to explore radically different methods of designing, building and shipping software, and I think the students can help us do it!</p>
<p>In next series of posts, I'll start diving into some of the Firefox OS academic interactions we've got going on, using them as case-studies for how Mozilla can benefit from these interactions.</p>
