<p>Ok, I said I'd come back with a more positive view of calendaring. Here it goes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.calconnect.org/">The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium</a><br />
- "The consortium is focused on the interoperable<br />
exchange of calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar<br />
programs,<br />
platforms, and technologies." Now *that's* what I'm talkin bout. But<br />
like any one of these interoperability groups, we'll have to wait and<br />
see if it has legs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/"></p>
<p>The Open Source Application Foundation</a> - Led by Mitch Kapor, this group is working on a PIM client that has sharing/syncing built into it's core.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dotmacsync/">iSync in OS X Tiger</a><br />
- Supposedly iSync in Tiger has an extensible architecture that allows<br />
developers to easily hook into it. Wow, that would be cool if it is<br />
*actually* open, and doesn't just allow developers to easily hook into<br />
.Mac...</p>
