<p><a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nusoap">NuSOAP Website</a><br />
This contains update announcements, API documentation, and links to resources such as the WSDL example provided below.</p>
<p><a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/index.php?category=NuSOAP">NuSOAP on my weblog</a><br />
This page has links to articles and tutorials about NuSOAP, as well as public examples of usage such as Amazon and Google.</p>
<p><a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/index.php?id=116">WROX NuSOAP Chapter</a><br />
Probably the most thorough overall guide to using NuSOAP. Doesn't contain WSDL generation information, but has just about everything else. A must-read for any NuSOAP user.</p>
<p>A thorough example of configuring and enabling wsdl for a server, using both simple and complex types, is available <br />
<a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nusoap/testbed/round2_base_server.phps">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once wsdl has been configured for a server instance, it can be generated by appending "?wsdl" onto the endpoint URL.<a href="">Link</a></p>
