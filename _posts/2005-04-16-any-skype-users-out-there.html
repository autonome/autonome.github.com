<p>I installed <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>, a free<br />
voice-over-IP app. It recognized my PS2 USB headset (which seems to be<br />
a regular Logitech USB headset with a Playstation logo on it), and the<br />
Skype test call worked just fine.</p>
<p> So I bought 10 Euros of<br />
Skypeout credit. Skypeout is the service which allows you use Skype to<br />
call non-Skype numbers. I.E., regular phones. This also worked without<br />
a hitch. Well, almost: the sound quality is BAD. And the delay is BAD<br />
too. What a shame.</p>
<p> Has anyone else used Skype or Skypeout? Any tips on making it usable?</p>
