<p>Though tragic, I'm still laughing after reading this::<br />
<blockquote><strong>Purity Distilling Company tank, 1919</strong><br />You gotta keep your molasses somewhere â€“ how about a rickety tank 50 feet tall and 90 feet in diameter in the middle of Boston? The structure was painted brown to hide the leaks. Eventually it burst (possibly exploding from fermentation), sending waves of molasses up to 15 feet high into the city and killing 21.</p></blockquote>
<p>That really was the best one in&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/start.html?pg=9">this list</a>.</p>
