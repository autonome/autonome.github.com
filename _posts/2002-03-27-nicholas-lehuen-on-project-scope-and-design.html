<p>"My point would be the same with any other language, and<br />
it's not rocket science : keep projects within precise functional<br />
boundaries, and use carefully designed API whenever you have to cross those<br />
boundaries. Don't think about building a project that spans those<br />
boundaries, let people who know how to handle the stuff from abroad handle<br />
it. If you're interested into changing your scope, then start a new project."<a href="">Link</a></p>
