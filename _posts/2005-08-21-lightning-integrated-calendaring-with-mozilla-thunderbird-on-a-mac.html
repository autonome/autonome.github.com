<p>Today I set up a Mozilla build-environment on my Powerbook, and builded-ed Mozilla Lightning, which aims to add tightly integrated calendaring functionality to Mozilla Thunderbird, the mail/news client.</p>
<p>From hanging out in #calendar on irc.mozilla.org, it appeared that most Lightning dev was happening on Windows, which meant that there weren't any nightly builds for us Mac users.</p>
<p>Building was surprisingly easy... and unsurprisingly long. The attached shot shows what it looks like so far.</p>
<p>I'll flex it's functionality when I get time, and will post about that as well. If you're brave/stupid, and want a copy of the xpi, let me know.</p>
