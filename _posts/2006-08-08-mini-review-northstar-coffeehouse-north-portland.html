<p>Good atmosphere, but small. Located off Interstate, one block north of Lombard, so it's pretty far out there, but accessible if you're stuck up in NOPO. It's right off the MAX line, and one block from the Fred Meyer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wi-fi: free</li>
<li>Coffee: Stumptown</li>
<li>Food: quality baked goods, bagels</li>
</ul>
