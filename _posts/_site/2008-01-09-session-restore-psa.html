<p>Thanks to efforts of many people in the Mozilla community, combined with tools like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a>, we seem to be awash in performance data and awareness these days. And in the wonderment of this new visiblity, <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/">Rob Sayre</a> and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/brendan/">Brendan Gregg</a> noticed that <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Session_Restore">Session Restore</a> was responsible for a significant portion of <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance:Tinderbox_Tests#Tp.2C_Tp2_and_the_Pageloader_extension:_Page_load_time">page-load</a> time! (/me takes an anxious bow, and dodges the tomatoes)</p>
<p>There are a couple of opportunities for improvement, chronicled <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=398807">here</a>. The first approach we're trying out is to save and restore less back-history for each tab. Easy to implement, but it wasn't the first choice since it decreased the utility of the feature... or so we thought, until <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics">Alex Polvi</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=398807#c45">provided some data</a> indicating that users very rarely go back further than 6 steps.</p>
<p>The change that landed today will reduce saving of back-history to 10 pages, from a default of 50. You can set the browser.sessionstore.max_tab_back_history pref to -1 if you want all tab history restored.</p>
<p>Comment on the bug if you're one of the &lt;1% who go back beyond 10, and are truly disgruntled about this change. Or better yet, fix my patch to cache tab history :)</p>
