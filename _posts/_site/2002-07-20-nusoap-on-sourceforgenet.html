<p>You can now get the latest version of NuSOAP via CVS at sourceforge.net. I build, test and update nusoap.php every time I commit, so you can get all classes at once, or download just the individual class you want to update:<br /><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/nusoap/lib/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/nusoap/lib/</a>.<br />
