<p>Thanks to a user on the nusoap-general list, I found that the <a href="http://www.phpgroup.org">San Francisco PHP Users Group</a> had the chapter I wrote for Professional Open Source Web Services available for download. Upon further research, I found that WROX used my chapter as the sample chapter for the book! Download the chapter <a href="/download.php?url=/nusoap/downloads/7469_Chap08.pdf">here</a> (PDF).<a href="http://www.wrox.com/books/sample-chapters/SampleChapter_1861007469.pdf">Link</a></p>
