<p>Foxylicious 0.2 is now available.</p>
<p>This version adds two new features:</p>
<p>1. Daily automatic updates</p>
<p>Foxylicious periodically checks to see if a new day has dawned since<br />
the last update. If it's a brand new day, an update will run<br />
automatically. This is off by default, and can be enabled via the<br />
Foxylicious settings page under the Tools menu.</p>
<p>2. Folder-based sub-categorization by a user-specified delimiter.</p>
<p>How's that for a feature name! Here's an example: If you<br />
sub-categorize your delicious tags using a dot syntax (windows.iis,<br />
windows.monopoly, windows.bsod), you can specify the dot as your<br />
delimiter, and Foxylicious will create subfolders for each<br />
sub-categorized tag! I've tested this up to 4 levels deep, and had no<br />
problems. THEORETICALLY, you should be able to create hierarchies as<br />
deep as whatever FF's maximum supported folder depth is (ie:<br />
cosmos.milky-way.solar-sytem.earth.primate.human.female.secretary.tickle-fetish<br />
- you get the picture).</p>
<p>Remember: This extension is only 2/10 of the way to 1.0, so if you<br />
find any bugs, please report them to me (politely) and I'll<br />
incorporate the fix into the next release.</p>
