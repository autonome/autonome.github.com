<p>At this point, I believe most SOAP plumbers have conceded that XML<br />
Schema will be the dominant type system and metadata format for interop.<br />
How one converts from their local type system to the world of XML Schema<br />
is a local problem that is (and should be) outside the scope of SOAP. </p>
<p>In MSFT-land, we do the conversion by importing XML Schema into our<br />
runtime and making the "foreign" types look local. That technology is<br />
broadly useful outside the scope of SOAP and/or web services, so we make<br />
it accessible everywhere, although I'm sure there are lots of customers<br />
who have no idea this is even in the platform.<a href="">Link</a></p>
