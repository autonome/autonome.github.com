<p>Nothing major to report. Some of the big projects are in the final stretch, which is great to see.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525013">Static build</a>: Joel's in cleanup phase, making sure the mobile tinderboxes build with the changes. Core patch is waiting on first review from Ted.</li>
<li>Ben's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=520309">fastload cache replacement</a> is waiting on first-review from Ben Smedberg.</li>
<li>Zach has <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513149#c22">more data</a> on the effect of the CSS parser optimizations he's been working on.</li>
<li>Asaf put up an <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=528884">experimental patch</a> for making the bookmarks toolbar all JS, no XBL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Related work I did this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started updating the <a href="http://graphs.mozilla.org/dashboard/snapshot/">Performance Snapshot</a>. Fixing a couple of bugs and making the percentages relative to the 3.6 branch.</li>
<li>Spent some time poking at the graph server. It's got serious performance problems, and is lacking a few features that'd make it immensely useful, instead of only somewhat useful. It just needs a little love, that's all.</li>
<li>Landed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506471">bug  506471</a>, moving FUEL out of the startup path.</li>
</ul>
