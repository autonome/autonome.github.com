<p>I was searching for a movie in my Netflix queue, and went up and down the queue a bunch of times before I finally found it. Yes, I know: a trivial annoyance. However, to quote Joel Spolsky, from his book <em>User Interface Design for Programmers</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even something that seems like a tiny, inconsequential frustration affects your mood. Your emotions don't seem to care about the magnitude of the event, only the quality. ... I started to learn that the days when I was happiest were the days with a lot of small successes and few small frustrations.</p></blockquote>
<p> So, here's a solution to a small frustration: <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nfqf/">nfqf</a> - a filtering search for your Netflix queue. It's a <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> script that adds a little search box at the top of your queue. Type characters in, and your queue will only show movies w/ titles that contain that string of characters.</p>
<p><a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nfqf/nfqf.user.js">Install</a>  </p>
<p>Caveat emptor: I'm not responsible for any malfunctions that may occur due to Netflix changing their site, or your decision to trust my ineptitude.</p>
<p>Ta,</p>
