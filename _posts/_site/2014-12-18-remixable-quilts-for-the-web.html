<p><a href="https://twitter.com/toolness" target="_blank">Atul Varma</a> set up a <a href="http://quilts.mozillacamp.org/2012/asia/" target="_blank">quilt</a> for MozCamp Asia 2012 which I thought was a fantastic tool for that type of event. It provided an engaging visualization, was collaboratively created, and allowed a quick and easy way to dive further into the details about the participating groups.</p>

<p>This week I finally got around to moving the code over to Mozilla Webmaker, so it could be easily copied and remixed. I made a couple of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update font to Open Sans</li>
<li>Make it easy and clear how to re-theme the colors</li>
<li>Allow arbitrary content in squares</li>
</ul>
<p>The JS code is still a bit too complex for what's needed, but it works on Webmaker now!</p>
