<p>The numbers aren't updated yet, as they were oddly counter-intuitive. Firefox 3.5 showed a massive week-over-week improvement in cold startup on Windows, which from what I can tell is not expected. On Leopard, cold startup shows a couple of percentage point improvement over last week, which is expected. Warm startup for Mac shows a 20% improvement over 3.5, but a 10% *regression* from last week, contradicting the numbers from Ts. Again, counter-intuitive numbers given that we landed a bunch of changes focused squarely on startup performance during that period.</p>
<p>Fortuitously, Alice and the release engineering team <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510587">deployed automated cold startup testing for Mac and Linux</a>. This gives us per-checkin visibility of cold startup times, and removes the need for error-prone local measurements for those platforms. On <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522807">Windows we haven't yet figured out how to emulate cold startup reliably</a>, so that's the next step.</p>
<p>As usual, more details and links are  available on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Startup_Time_Improvements">the  project wiki</a>, and we're available to answer questions in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#startup">#startup on irc.mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>B<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511761">ug   511761</a> landed, Ben Hsieh's work to optimize fastload cache invalidation, with a  3% win on warm startup of WinXP.</li>
<li>Alfred Kayser put a patch up on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511754">bug 511754</a>, which improves JAR file reading efficiency.</li>
<li>Rob Strong closed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=521956">bug 521956</a> and started some cleanup of nsUpdateService, further reducing the size of it for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311965">bug 311965</a>.</li>
<li>Drew has a patch up for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506814">bug 506814</a>, getting rid of Change  GetPersistentDescriptor/SetPersistentDescriptor on Mac.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504858">Bug      504858</a> pushes back the population of the bookmarks toolbar until   after   the  browser window comes up. Dao put up a new patch. Measuring  the wall-clock effect of this on startup, and determining what exactly  is "gaming" the Ts test is part of the work here.</li>
<li>Service caching work in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=516085">bug     516085</a> still needs to be pushed  to  the  Places branch for testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects in a holding pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving font-loading out of the startup path on Mac: Jonathan Kew  filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519445">bug    519445</a> with a WIP patch for yet further reductions in Mac startup    time spent in font system initialization.</li>
<li>JARification: David abandoned <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509755">moving JS       modules into a JAR file</a>, since those files are fastloaded.      However, since we want things like post-extension-install restarts to  be     fast, and those cause fastload cache invalidation, we might want  to   do   things like this anyways. I filed a bug for the same treatment  for     components. These are lower priority, since they're not the  normal     startup case. Follow along with all JAR-ification via<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513027"> the      tracker  bug</a>.</li>
<li>Startup Timeline: No updates, still not landed. Add [ft] in the     whiteboard of your bug w/ the function names you want timed and David     will generate it and update the bug.</li>
<li>Static Analysis: No progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128">bug     506128</a>.  David needs to file a bug with the final log of     named-yet-uncalled  functions.</li>
<li>Dirty Profile Testing: No progress. Need to list scenarios, file     bugs  for each, generate Talos config patches and profile data, and then     move  it into Rel-Eng territory. Also, need to get a separate    Tinderbox  tree,  since itâ€™s going to cause a bazillion new columns.</li>
<li><a href="http://wagerlabs.com/">Joel     Reymont</a> noted in<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513076"> bug     513076</a> that there are serious drawbacks to getting our libraries in     the dyld  shared cache on Mac, so has deprioritized that work.</li>
<li>No updates on Zack's CSS parser changes in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513149">bug       513149</a>.</li>
