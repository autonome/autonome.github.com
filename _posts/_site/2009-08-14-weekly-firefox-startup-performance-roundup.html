<p>Here's a summary of all the startup-related work going on. Other people on the team are also blogging updates on their individual projects:</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419893">PGO for SQLite, MozStorage and Places</a>: Landed on the Places branch. The test failures seen when PGO first landed are not there (yay), but the Talos boxes don't show any clear wins (boo).</li>
<li>Dead Code Hunting: Even though he's supposed to be on vacation, David has got the full browser.xul environment pulled in for analysis. More info in his post (linked above). Still a lot of false-positives in the detection code.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480735">Startup timeline</a>: Vlad's been working with the NSPR owner, and the latest patch has review, so almost there.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507038">XPCOM component combining</a>: No progress from me, but Florian Quèze <span><em></em></span>attached a shell script to knit the components together!</li>
<li>XPT Linking on Mac: Drew has confirmed big wins from this, split it off into it's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510309">own bug</a>. More detailed notes from him on his <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Startup_Time_Improvements/adw_notes">wiki page.</a></li>
<li>JARification
<ul>
<li>Taras' <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504864">core IO improvements to how JAR file contents are read</a> have landed, as well as the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=468011">combining of all chrome into browser and toolkit JARs</a> (this morning!).</li>
<li>Ryan is looking at putting the components directory into a JAR so that it reaps the same benefits as the chrome directories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing/Measurement
<ul>
<li>Met with Alice to talk about various test scenarios, and the deployment process</li>
<li>Started a guide for <a title="Creating a new Talos test" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Testing/Talos/NewTests">taking a Talos test from idea to production</a></li>
<li>Initial steps on automatedly testing cold-startup, figuring out platform-specific calls, and what Talos changes are needed</li>
<li>Discussing approaches to micro-benchmarking the browser UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable PGO on mozilla-central, get nightly tester feedback</li>
<li>Once the startup timeline lands, get an actual timeline to analyze</li>
<li>Reduce false-positives on the dead-code report, document installation and usage, develop plan for continuous integration</li>
<li>Work with Ted to get a patch for JS component combining into the packaging process</li>
<li>Figure out if there's a win in jar'ing /components or if we just need to fix fastload to not touch the files as much</li>
<li>Get XPT linking landed</li>
<li>File bugs and get the Talos changes in Alice's queue for cold-startup testing</li>
<li>Finish the Talos test development guide</li>
<li>Talk with Ryan Doherty about the reporting side of microbenchmarking</li>
</ul>
