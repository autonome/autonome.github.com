<p>No update on the ongoing code projects this week. However, we investigated the extension performance work I mentioned <a href="http://autonome.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/firefox-startup-performance-march-5-2010/">last week</a>, and got a conversation going, with posts by <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2010/03/11/extensions-startup/">Taras</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2010/03/startup_penalty_repo.html">Asa</a> and <a href="http://autonome.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/firefox-extensions-and-performance/">myself</a>. I've listed the various ideas and approaches that came out of those posts and comments <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Addons">here</a>.</p>
