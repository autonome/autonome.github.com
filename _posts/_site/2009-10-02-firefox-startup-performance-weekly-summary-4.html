<p>This week brought a big win on Mac, and a slew of changes that are about to land.</p>
<p>Recent activity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517045">Bug 517045</a> is fixed and brings another win on Mac. Found by Joel Reymont and fixed by John Daggett, it improves cold startup by ~20% and warm startup by ~4%. It gets better: Jonathan Kew filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519445">bug 519445</a> with a WIP patch for yet further reductions in Mac startup time spent in font system initialization.</li>
<li>Taras Glek's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507288">work on combining the     different preference files</a> into a single one is ready to land.</li>
<li>We now have unit-tested optimized builds, thanks to Release Engineering's work on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=486783">bug 486783</a>. This means we can now turn on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419893">PGO for Places, mozStorage and SQLite</a>, which I'll land presently.</li>
<li>B<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504858">ug    504858</a> pushes back the population of the bookmarks toolbar until after   the  browser window comes up. The patch has review, is ready to land.</li>
<li>Alfred Kayser's patch on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510844">bug    510844</a> which should increase throughput of JAR file reading, is   ready to land.</li>
<li>Ben Hsieh got review on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510991">bug 510991</a>, which removes some stats() from the startup path.</li>
<li>I'm no longer able to reproduce the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517741">cold startup regression from 3.5 to 3.6</a>. I turned of SuperFetch, which resulted in more stable numbers, but there was no visible regression, even in builds going back a couple of months. Juan is going to test on Windows XP.</li>
<li>Ben Hsieh has a patch up for review on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511761">bug   511761</a>, which removes needless stat()s of component files, and improves and clarifies current cache invalidation behavior.</li>
<li>Service caching work in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=516085">bug   516085</a>, made no progress. Next week I'll try pushing this  to the Places branch to get a better idea of the total performance  impact of the change.</li>
<li>Zack is working on major CSS parser changes in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513149">bug    513149</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects in a holding pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold Startup Testing: Drew and Alice made a bunch of progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510587">bug    510587</a>,  to create a new Ts that measures cold startup. Alice is    working on mobile Talos though, so this is sidelined for a bit. The only    issue left is reliable Windows measurement, but we're not going to    block on it, can live with Mac and Linux to start off.</li>
<li>JARification: David abandoned <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509755">moving JS     modules into a JAR file</a>, since those files are fastloaded.    However, since we want things like post-extension-install restarts to be    fast, and those cause fastload cache invalidation, we might want to  do   things like this anyways. I filed a bug for the same treatment for    components. These are lower priority, since they're not the normal    startup case. Follow along with all JAR-ification via<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513027"> the    tracker  bug</a>.</li>
<li>Startup Timeline: No updates, still not landed. Add [ft] in the   whiteboard of your bug w/ the function names you want timed and David   will generate it and update the bug.</li>
<li>Static Analysis: No progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128">bug   506128</a>.  David needs to file a bug with the final log of   named-yet-uncalled  functions.</li>
<li>Dirty Profile Testing: No progress. Need to list scenarios, file   bugs  for each, generate Talos config patches and profile data, and then   move  it into Rel-Eng territory. Also, need to get a separate  Tinderbox  tree,  since itâ€™s going to cause a bazillion new columns.</li>
<li><a href="http://wagerlabs.com/">Joel   Reymont</a> noted in<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513076"> bug   513076</a> that there are serious drawbacks to getting our libraries in   the dyld  shared cache on Mac, so has deprioritized that work.</li>
</ul>
