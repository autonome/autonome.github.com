<p>I was looking at about:memory and noticed entries for Facebook and Google+ URLs, even though I didn't have either open. I figured they were probably from the social buttonry that decorates the web these days. No big deal... except they were taking up a bunch of memory! The Facebook button was using over 20mb and the Google+ button was taking over 40mb!</p>
<p>I have never clicked either of these buttons.</p>
<p>So I wrote Wallflower, a simple Firefox add-on (restartless of course) that removes these buttons from any page your browse to, saving your precious memory, CPU and battery life for the content you actually want.</p>
