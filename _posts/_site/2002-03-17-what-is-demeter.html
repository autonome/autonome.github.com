<p>"An important concept of Demeter is to split software <br />
into at least two parts: The first part defines the objects.  <br />
The second part defines the operations.  The goal of <br />
Demeter is to maintain a loose coupling between the <br />
objects and the operations, so that one can <br />
make modifications to either without serious impact <br />
on the other.  This cuts down significantly on <br />
maintenance time."<a href="">Link</a></p>
