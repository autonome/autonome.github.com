<p>NuSOAP is a rewrite of SOAPx4, provided by <a href="http://www.nusphere.com">NuSphere</a>.<br />
    NuSOAP  is a group of PHP classes that allow developers to create and consume SOAP web services.<br />
    It does not require any special PHP extensions, which makes it usable by all PHP developers, regardless of ISP, server or platform.<br />
    Beware, I haven't gotten usage of PHPDoc quite right, so the API docs are a bit wonky at this point.<br />

<p>NuSOAP will be distributed with <a href="http://www.nusphere.com">NuSphere's PHPEd 3.0</a>, along with a wizard that generates PHP code for client web service operations using NuSOAP. Any questions? <a href="mailto:dietrich@ganx4.com">Email</a> me.
<p>Features:
<ul>
<li>Preliminary support for WSDL on the server: You can bind a server instance to a local or remote WSDL document.</li>
<li>SSL support if PHP has the CURL extension compiled in.</li>
<li>Serialization directly from WSDL: No more soapval object tree. Great performance boost here, as well as more precise type-mapping.</li>
<li>HTTP proxy support: very simple usage. Just pass your proxy host and port to the setHTTPProxy() method of the soapclient object, and you're good to go.</li>
<li>Most of the classes have been completely overhauled for performance: speed and resource usage.This also eliminated *many* bugs.</li>
<li>Proxy class: new proxy class allows for calling services like this:<br />
echo $soap-&gt;getStockQuote('IBM');</li>
<li>Streaming single-pass multi-ref de-serialization: the entire process of decoding a XML SOAP message into PHP native types is now done in the initial parsing of the message. No hash of nodes, no recursing through the hash to create a huge object tree, no recursing *back* through the object tree to convert into PHP native types. Huge performance increase and dramatic drop in resource consumption here.</li>
<li>SOAP Header support. Currently getting 194/60 on the SOAPBuilders Round 2, Group C tests, most failures due to remote server.</li>
<li>ID/Href: We can now de-serialize messages that use references.</li>
<li>Document/literal: SOAPx4 now fully supports doc/literal operations. It can also create stub XML documents from XML Schema type definitions, that users can 'fill in the blanks', and use for doc/lit operations.
</li>
<li>WSDL import: We now support the import functionality.</li>
<li>Multidimensional array encoding and decoding for the client and server classes.</li>
</ul>
