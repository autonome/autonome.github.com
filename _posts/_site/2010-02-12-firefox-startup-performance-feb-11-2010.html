<p>Various minor updates this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=525013">Static build</a>: Ted did the first pass of review. Getting close. Will land on the Places branch once binary tests build, to see perf impact.</li>
<li>Ben's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=520309">fastload cache replacement</a> is still waiting on first-review from Ben Smedberg.</li>
<li>Neil took up <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354048">bug 354048</a> to not rebuild toolbars at startup, should reduce the DOM activity some at least. The patch is in review by Dao and Mano.</li>
<li>Marco has nearly completed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=542943">bug 542943</a>, removing the bookmark redirect hash, which means less SQL at startup and less memory usage by the bookmarks service.</li>
<li>I put a patch up on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=545516">bug 545516</a> that fixes some bugs and cleans up the layout of the <a href="http://graphs.mozilla.org/dashboard/snapshot/">Performance Snapshot</a>. Will get it landed next week.</li>
<li>Started working with John O'Duinn and Mike Morgan to get a team together to work on the graph server.</li>
</ul>
