<li>An improvement in startup time on Mac Leopard of around ~16% (aka: Very Large) was found by Joel Reymont and fixed by Masayuki Nakano in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517549">bug 517549</a>. Mac users rejoice!</li>
<li>The Windows cold startup regression from 3.5 to 3.6 being tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=517741">bug  517741</a>. Help finding the window for this would be awesome.</li>
<li>JAR Performance: Alfred Kayser has a new patch on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510844">bug  510844</a> which should increase throughput of JAR file reading, about ready to land.</li>
<li>Ben Hsieh is making progress removing the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=512827">needless  stats of already-fastloaded components</a> and other stat removals in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511761">bug  511761</a>.</li>
<li>Service caching work is still in progress in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=516085">bug  516085</a>. Drew's tests showed no significant win on Tp, but the patch did reduce IO service retrievals by 58%. It might be worth pushing this to the Places branch to get a better idea of the total performance impact of the change.</li>
<li>Ryan Flint landed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=499123">bug 499123</a>, combining a bunch of about: pages into a single component, on 1.9.2 branch for Firefox 3.6.</li>
<li>Bookmarks toolbar: I put a patch on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504858">bug 504858</a> that pushes back the population of the toolbar until after the browser window comes up. Checking into the Places branch showed a 1.5% improvement to warm startup on Windows. Just waiting on review.</li>
<li>CSS Parsing Time: Zack is working on major CSS parser changes in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513149">bug   513149</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects in a holding pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preference Files: Taras Glek has been working on combining the   different preference files into a single one at build time, in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507288">bug   507288</a>. The patch is there, and is just trying to find a way to land   cleanly.</li>
<li>Cold Startup Testing: Drew and Alice made a bunch of progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510587">bug   510587</a>,  to create a new Ts that measures cold startup. Alice is   working on mobile Talos though, so this is sidelined for a bit. The only   issue left is reliable Windows measurement, but we're not going to   block on it, can live with Mac and Linux to start off.</li>
<li>JARification: David abandoned <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=509755">moving JS    modules into a JAR file</a>, since those files are fastloaded.   However, since we want things like post-extension-install restarts to be   fast, and those cause fastload cache invalidation, we might want to do   things like this anyways. I filed a bug for the same treatment for   components. These are lower priority, since they're not the normal   startup case. Follow along with all JAR-ification via<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513027"> the   tracker  bug</a>.</li>
<li>Startup Timeline: No updates, still not landed. Add [ft] in the  whiteboard of your bug w/ the function names you want timed and David  will generate it and update the bug.</li>
<li>PGO for Places, mozStorage and SQLite: Still blocking on Rel-Eng  fixing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=486783">bug  486783</a>, which now has patches!</li>
<li>Static Analysis: No progress on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128">bug  506128</a>.  David needs to file a bug with the final log of  named-yet-uncalled  functions.</li>
<li>Dirty Profile Testing: No progress. Need to list scenarios, file  bugs  for each, generate Talos config patches and profile data, and then  move  it into Rel-Eng territory. Also, need to get a separate Tinderbox  tree,  since itâ€™s going to cause a bazillion new columns.</li>
<li><a href="http://wagerlabs.com/">Joel  Reymont</a> noted in<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513076"> bug  513076</a> that there are serious drawbacks to getting our libraries in  the dyld  shared cache on Mac, so has deprioritized that work.</li>
</ul>
