<p>Prompted by <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=649999&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=">a request</a> in the build forum, I've added a feature that allows you to tag all bookmarks with the name of their containing folder. It also provides the option to tag the bookmark with the name of each ancestor folder in the hierarchy. For example, given a folder hierarchy of Folder1/Folder2/Bookmark1, Bookmark1 would be tagged with both "Folder1" and "Folder2".</p>
