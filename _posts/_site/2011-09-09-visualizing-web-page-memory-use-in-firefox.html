<p>I remixed about:memory using <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">D3</a> to make a treemap visualization of how loaded URLs are using memory in Firefox.</p>
<p>Load it by clicking the widget on the add-on bar, or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Y</p>
<p>This visualization focuses on which web pages are using large amounts of memory - this is not a complete accounting of all memory being used. This doesn't yet show how much is being used by some of the Firefox internals.</p>
<p>Add-on installation does not require a restart. Only tested on Nightly builds.</p>
