<p>Much thanks to <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/ndeakin/">Neil Deakin</a>, who commented on my previous post with a pointer to the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:SDK">Gecko SDK</a>. The Gecko SDK allows developers to compile XPIDL typelibs without having to fetch and build the Mozilla source tree. However, as usual there is no Mac version :P</p>
<p>I've zipped up my copy and put it <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/">here</a>. Compiled from the 1.8 tree, on OSX 10.4.5.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.iosart.com/firefox/gecko-sdk-macosx/">Alex Sirota</a> for his helpful instructions for building a standalone SDK for OSX.</p>
<p>Also, I've moved the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/How_to_Build_an_XPCOM_Component_in_Javascript">JS XPCOM "Hello World" tutorial</a> to the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Center</a>, and  updated it to use the SDK instead of building from the source.</p>
<p>UPDATE: This evening, the surge of immense pain brought on by the masochistic activity known as "jogging" caused this thought to arise: "Oh shit. Are there any licensing issues with having some Mozilla binaries posted here?"</p>
