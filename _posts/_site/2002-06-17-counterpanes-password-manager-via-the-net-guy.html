<p>"Here's the coolest free program you're probably not using: Password Safe. It's brought to you by security guru Bruce Schneier, author of Applied Cryptography. I've been using this for about 3 years now, and it's super. People occasionally ask me what a good program is for managing passwords, and everybody walks away happy with a copy of this super utility. Enjoy!"<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/passsafe.html">Link</a></p>
