<p>I've been working on the Jetpack project for about a month now - implementing features, fixing bugs, and generally helping move things forward as we build out the wide set of capabilities needed to enable an *awesome* future for Firefox add-on development.</p>
<p>The Jetpack team <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/jetpack/2010/04/29/announcing-jetpack-sdk-0-3/">released the 0.3 version of the SDK</a> yesterday, which has a bunch of platform improvements, and also the <a href="https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/0.3/docs/#module/jetpack-core/context-menu">context menu API</a> - the first UI feature to ship in the SDK. The <a href="https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/sdk/0.3/docs/#guide/programs">SDK documentation has an example</a> of using this feature that shows 1) how easy it is to build UI features with Jetpack, but also 2) shows how add-on development process has *changed* with the SDK. For example, all of the manual packaging steps are *gone*. That's right. No more crazy directory structures, no more RDF files, no more GUIDs. All of that stuff is gone, replaced with a couple of simple commands. It's not perfect yet, but expect it to get even easier to both package and deploy add-ons as we build out the SDK further.</p>
<p>So what's next? The 0.4 release is where the feature set of the SDK really starts to blow up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/103">Panels</a>: Floating rich content, tooltips, contextual UI.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/116">Private Browsing</a>: Making it easy for add-ons to respect your privacy.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/111">Selection</a>: Remember how awesome it was having an intuitive selection API in Ubiquity?</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/113">Localization</a>: Simple access and distribution of locale data.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/108">Page Worker</a>: Like a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers">Web Worker</a>, but with more privileges and a DOM.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/104">Simple Storage</a>: Persistent object store - like DOMStorage for add-ons.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/114">Places</a>: Improved bookmarks and history searching and browsing.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/102">Widgets</a>: A preview of the ideas <a href="http://mozillalabs.com/jetpack/2010/04/08/the-single-ui-element/">Daniel</a> and <a href="http://jboriss.wordpress.com/2010/04/29/removing-firefoxs-status-bar-and-rehousing-add-on-icons-part-1-of-2/">Boriss</a> have recently blogged about.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/Reboot/JEP/109">Request</a>: Even easier AJAX (Please don't make that into an acronym. Please.)</li>
<li>Installable without needing to restart Firefox (trunk builds only).</li>
<li>Documentation: More and better!</li>
</ul>
<p>And it's not just about the feature set: The diligent focus of the Jetpack core team on developer ergonomics, and the experience gained from the Jetpack prototype and projects like Ubiquity, is resulting in a set of APIs that are far more intuitive and easy to use than the current XPCOM-riddled minefield that add-on developers have to deal with today.</p>
