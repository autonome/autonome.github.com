<p>Last night we went to a panel discussion on the Bush administration's warrant-less wiretapping program, at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">PSU</a> in downtown Portland. It was put on by the <a href="http://www.nwcrc.org/">NWCRC</a> and <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/">PFAW</a>, and featured a professor/lawyer, a lawyer handling a case against the government over warrant-less wiretapping, and an activist.</p>
<p>It was f*ckin' scary.</p>
<p>But it was also extremely interesting, and at times even funny. It's inspiring and humbling to see these smart and talented people out there fighting our government's encroachments on our rights, on a daily basis. And it's uplifting to see that it's possible to keep a sense of humor while doing it... because if we can no longer laugh, then the fascists have truly won.</p>
<p>Yes, you are under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>DANCE!</strong></p>
