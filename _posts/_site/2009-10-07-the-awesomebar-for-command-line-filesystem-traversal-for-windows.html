<p>Autojump is a command-line utility that "learns" from your filesystem navigation via the "cd" command, and allows you to jump quickly to oft-travelled-to directories. Source, installation and usage information are at <a href="http://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">Github</a>. After seeing <a href="http://twitter.com/dalmaer/statuses/4685018591">this tweet from Dion</a>, I went to install it, only to remember that I'm on Windows 7 now. Bah. So, I tweaked it a bit to run inside the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Windows_Build_Prerequisites#MozillaBuild">MozillaBuild</a> environment. Assuming you've cloned/downloaded Autojump, here are the steps to get it working:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Mingw, navigate to the autojump source directory</li>
<li>Remove all instances of "sudo" from the install.sh file</li>
<li>Get your Python path: $ which python</li>
<li>Replace /usr/bin/python with your Python path in the autojump file</li>
<li>Run install.sh</li>
</ol>
