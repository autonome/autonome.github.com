<p>The subway doors open. A hobo enters, holding a bottle of windex in one hand and a tube of toothpaste in the other. He says: Which is the better time to read Dostyevsky? Winter?</p>
<p></p>
<p>He sprays the windex.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hobo: Or Spring? </p>
<p></p>
<p>He squeezes toothpaste out of the tube.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Japanese girl: Spring!</p>
<p>Hobo: You are correct.</p>
