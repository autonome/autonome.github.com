<p>"I still don't understand why validation is not performed in a SAX filter rather than in parsers. Parsers like Xerces have dramatically grown in size and have performance problem due to the fact that validation is built in the parser. </p>
<p>To me, parsing and validating are two different activities. They may have<br />
been integrated for performance reasons of the parsing+validation pipeline,<br />
but I'd still like to have a clean, high performance parsing pipeline in<br />
which I could plugin any kind of validators (eg. Sun MSV).</p>
<p>Take the bug that causes Xerces 2 to dereference and parse schemas even if<br />
validation is disabled for example. I hope it has been fixed since, but if Xerces 2 was not mixing a lot of APIs and technologies (parsing, validating, building a DTD specific DOMs, etc.) in a monolithic way, the bug would have never appeared in the first place."<a href="">Link</a></p>
