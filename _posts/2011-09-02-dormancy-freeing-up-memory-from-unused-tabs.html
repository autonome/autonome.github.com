<p>Dormancy 'retires' tabs that have gone unused for a while, freeing up that memory. It then restores the tabs to life when accessed.</p>
<p>While Firefox 9 adds restore-on-demand for users that restore their session by default, many users will never benefit from it. This add-on targets users who don't restore session, but do have long-running instances of Firefox and many tabs. This might land as a core feature in Firefox 9 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=675539).</p>
<p>NOTE: This is highly experimental, has only been tested on the Nightly builds, and probably will destroy your session. You've been warned.</p>
<p>Tabs are considered inactive when they haven't been selected in longer than 5 minutes. To change that, set this pref to a value in milliseconds:</p>
<p>* extensions.dormancy.TabDormancyAgeMs</p>
<p>Tabs are checked for inactivity every 5 minutes. To change this, set this pref to a value in milliseconds:</p>
<p>* extensions.dormancy.TabCheckIntervalMs</p>
<p>Known bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awesomebar entry for dormant tabs shows data URI</li>
<li>Sometimes dormant tabs have no title and no favicon</li>
</ul>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL. MAY EAT YOUR SESSION OR DO OTHER BAD THINGS.</p>
