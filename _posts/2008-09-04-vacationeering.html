<p>We stayed on Ambergris Caye in Belize for a week (<a title="Belize pics" href="http://flickr.com/photos/autonome/sets/72157607081080301/">pics</a>), 1/2 mile from the 2nd largest coral reef in the world. We then went overland to see the Mayan ruins at Tikal in Guatemala (<a title="Tikal pics" href="http://flickr.com/photos/autonome/sets/72157607078313286/">pics</a>).</p>
<p>We got stuck in Dallas on the way back, so flew back Monday morning, dropped our stuff off at the house and went straight to Kumoricon, Portland's anime/manga/cosplay convention (<a title="Kumoricon pictures" href="http://flickr.com/photos/autonome/sets/72157607085145227/">pics</a>)!</p>
<p>What a crazy week. Ok, back to work.</p>
