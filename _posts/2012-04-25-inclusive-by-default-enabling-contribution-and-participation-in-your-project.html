<p>You work on an open source project. You work for an open source company. You might think you're open. But do you act open?</p>
<ul>
<li>How hard is it for someone to ask you a question?</li>
<li>How hard is it for someone to learn the how/where/what/when/why for your project?</li>
<li>If I wanted to help today, would you have something queued up for me to do?</li>
</ul>
<p>contribution, participation and inclusion. things people do that help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting announcements: Send them! To all the lists where you have contributors or interested parties! Include detailed information about how to participate, such as time in several timezones, phone information (including country code and Skype number), and</li>
<li>Meeting minutes: Ask someone to take detailed minutes for every meeting. Reply to the original meeting announcement with the minutes, with both the text inline and a link.</li>
<li>Videoconferencing: Ensure you provide a call-in number for non-video participants. If using Vidyo, provide a URL that links directly to the meeting room.</li>
<li>Audio-conferencing: If you're not talking, mute yourself. Wait at least 10 seconds before moving on to the next topic to allow people to unmute themselves. Use a headset - speakerphone *always* makes it more difficult for you to be heard. If someone is echoing on the call and you think it's not you, you're wrong.</li>
<li>Ask for feedback *before* announcing decisions. If you announce your conclusion.</li>
<li>Creation is contribution. Anything else is window dressing.</li>
<li>        - asking to help develop a project instead of just asking for likes/retweets.</li>
<li>        - filing bugs for the work you need done. seriously, i can't tell you how many times a week i talk to someone who has not created an actionable thing around which work can be discussed, iterated on and completed. like it or not, bugzilla is that thing.</li>
<li>        - blogging.</li>
<li>        - if you can't respond, acknowledge. it's like when you get sat a table in a busy restaurant, and the server keeps walking by you helping other tables, but doesn't even look at you. it makes a huge difference and you're willing to wait when they at least stop by quickly and say "i'm super busy, i know you're here, and i'll be over as soon as i can." if you can't answer a question or review a patch just yet, drop a quick comment acknowledging the request. it makes all the difference in the world.</li>
<li>        - dteller's status update vs glandium's status update</li>
<li>        - when talking about bugs in any medium (email, irc, twitter) always put the word "bug" before the bug number. many clients have plugins or some other way to automatically link to the bug. eg, on irc if you say "can you look at 345334?" no client will link it. instead say "can you look at bug 345334?"</li>
</ul>
<p>- broad concepts learned<br />
- communicate early and often<br />
- always acknowledge, even when you can't respond<br />
- delegate instead of owning</p>
