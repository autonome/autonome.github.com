<p>"This utility strips proprietary Microsoft tags and artefacts from Word HTML documents, leaving basic formatting and typographic entities intact. Curled quotes and em and en dashes should come through fine, as long as they existed in the original Word document: run Autoformat to be sure."<a href="http://www.textism.com/article/428/">Link</a></p>
