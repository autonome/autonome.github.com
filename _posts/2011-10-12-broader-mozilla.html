<p>While known primarily for Firefox, Mozilla is a *very* wide-ranging project. We talk about our activities world-wide, both as a project and as a company within that project. But how does it all break down?</p>
<p>Where is the project spending people-time? What are the departmental proportions in the company, and in the project as a whole? Who are the volunteers, where do they come from, and what proportion and parts of the project's activity do they drive? Where does the organization spend money, and where are we not investing? Who's checking in code, and on what parts of the project?</p>
<p>And what does the larger sphere of activity enabled by Mozilla look like? For example, see this bit from the Mozilla 2009 Annual Report:</p>
<p><em>Mozilla supported projects in 2009 included contributions to accessibility, community support, and education including such organizations as Mozdev, Software Freedom Conservancy, Seneca College, University of Toronto, UC Irvine, NorthEastern University, Creative Commons, Paciello Group, StopBadWare, the W3C, and accessibility support such as Orca screen reader, jQuery library and HTML 5 video.</em></p>
<p>That's amazing. I have no idea what some of these contributions are about. What are we currently enabling via WebFWD, Drumbeat, grants and even volunteer time that Mozilla project members spend helping out other non-profits and/or software projects?Â  We sponsor many events around the world - but which ones, where and about what? Hey, did you know we're members of the SQLite Consortium?!</p>
<p>There's so much about Mozilla that we at Mozilla don't even know, let alone the half-billion users or the world beyond them.</p>
