<ol>
<li>Uninstall the printer, if already installed from a previous version of OS X, or from previous attempts to install Lexmark's drivers</li>
<li>Open Finder, click on your HD, find Library/Printers/Lexmark, and rename it to Lexmark.bak</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Insert your Leopard DVD, double-click Optional Installs, double-click Optional Installs.mpkg</li>
<li>When Optional Installs has loaded, open Printer Drivers, and check the box next to Lexmark, then finish the installation process.</li>
<li>Open System Preferences, and then Printer and Fax</li>
<li>Click the + sign to add a new printer</li>
<li>Your P4350 should show up as "4300 Series Printer" in the list. Select it.</li>
<li>The dialog may spin for a few minutes. When done, it will enable the driver selection list. Select "4300 Series" from the list and click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to print. I did this on two different Macs, and it worked for both.</p>
