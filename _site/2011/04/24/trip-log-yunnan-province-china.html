    <p>4/2 Kunming, largest city in Yunnan province</p>
<ul>
<li>Hour and half flight from Chiang Mai.</li>
<li>Taxi ride: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623891907/in/set-72157626489333032">Volkswagen jetta</a>, driver has cage around himself, shouting into the phone the whole ride</li>
<li>Meet Alek and Thela at Camellia Hotel</li>
<li>Down an alley for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643626586/in/set-72157626489333032">street BBQ</a>, baijiao (sorghum liquor 56%), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624479158/in/set-72157626489333032">beer</a>, and Burmese rum (ouch).</li>
<li>We learned about gambay. it means that guys have to down the whole glass. women can just sip. Shauna is a bad-ass, gambays with the guys.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623885519/in/set-72157626489333032/">Hundreds of skewers</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624477632/in/set-72157626489333032">Whole eggplant, grilled, then sliced, served in it's own skin, with sauce of ground pork poured over it</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623889095/in/set-72157626489333032/">And Shiloh got noodle soup</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/3 A day in Kunming</p>
<ul>
<li>The gambay lesson was hard learned. Hurty head.</li>
<li>Electric scooters are silent and everywhere. I'm sure people get hit all the time because they don't hear them.</li>
<li>The whole city seems quiet and clean. Not Hanoi. Alek says this is a new phenomenon.</li>
<li>Sim card for 15USD. GPRS 500mb 15USD. GPRS is fast here. 3G advertised everywhere in the whole country. Never worked for me though.</li>
<li>Tried to get a camera charger. Guy at cellphone shop called a guy, who delivered it there in 10 minutes. Didn't work though. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624488710/in/set-72157626489333032">The shop had some great phone brands that'll look familiar to you</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623892757/in/set-72157626489333032">Over The Bridge noodles</a> at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624487342/in/set-72157626489333032">Brothers Jiang</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623893289/in/set-72157626489333032">This shit had BEES in it</a>. Very interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623902145/in/set-72157626489333032">Golden horse emerald chicken park</a>. Yeah, that's it's full name.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623923247/in/set-72157626489333032">Huge walking mall, many many city blocks</a>. With fancy stores and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624511458/in/set-72157626489333032">a fashion show</a>.</li>
<li>Needed coffee. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624495172/in/set-72157626489333032">Only could find McDonalds</a>. Sad.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623913915/in/set-72157626489333032">A bunch of skaters outside</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623907789/in/set-72157626489333032">9 year-old smoking cigarettes while he skates</a>.</li>
<li>Btw, everyone has these tea containers with a filter of geniusness built-in. I got one. And then lost it.</li>
<li>Went to a big park, where lots of people were outside <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624518602/in/set-72157626489333032">making music</a>, dancing, singing. There were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623930563/in/set-72157626489333032">cool water toys</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624523504/in/set-72157626489333032">scary dolls</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623932761/in/set-72157626489333032">to ride</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624516602/in/set-72157626489333032">proximity-detecting automated garbage cans</a>.</li>
<li>Found a little local joint for dinner. A bunch of the patrons were the musicians from the park. The food was again epic - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624529052/in/set-72157626489333032/">many kinds of veggie and mushroom dishes, cured pork, soup</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/4 Zhongdian</p>
<ul>
<li>Saw what can only be described as "megahousing" developments outside of Kunming.</li>
<li>Factories everywhere, in suburbs outside the city. Saw a red cloud over a valley of factories. Red.</li>
<li>Oh look, that is a road. On a cliff along the river. How. The. Hell.</li>
<li>Himalayan mountains in the distance? Easily twice as tall as the giant mountains we're flying over.</li>
<li>Land in Zhongdian. Small airport, but clearly new. Full of Tibetan items, and cold-weather gear. It's COLD.</li>
<li>One hour flight, landing at 12,000ft above sea-level. Yeah, we all ended up with mild altitude sickness for the first day. That kinda sucked.</li>
<li>Zhongdian was renamed Shangri-La 10 years ago to increase tourism.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615598577/in/set-72157626364130939">Yak fields on the way to town.</a></li>
<li>More Jetta cabs. Must be state-mandated.</li>
<li>Populace is Tibetan mostly, but many other ethnic minorities present.</li>
<li>Pink hat ladies! Scarf tied around hats.</li>
<li>Old town. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615582667/in/set-72157626364130939">Cobblestone streets. Carved wood structures.</a></li>
<li>Fashion for guys is like 80s bad boy. Or black blazer and slacks... for doing manual labor.</li>
<li>Women wearing slave-to-fashion wear, or traditional garb. Not much in between.</li>
<li>Lunch spots advertise with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616165496/in/set-72157626364130939">bao steamers</a>. Ate at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615585881/in/set-72157626364130939">East City North Cooked Wheaten Food King</a>.

<li>Land of no salad. Seriously, there's almost no fresh vegetables in any food we had the whole trip. Always cooked.</li>
<li>Last day of Cleaning the Grave holiday. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615712971/in/set-72157626364130939">Half the town was in the graveyard</a> as we checked in, lighting off firecrackers by the grave.</li>
<li>Checked into the guesthouse. No inside heat in the guesthouses.</li>
<li>Meet Alek's friend Meow Meow (sp?)</li>
<li>No running water for 4 months during winter because pipes are frozen.</li>
<li>Nightly dancing in both the old-town center, and new-town center. They like to dance.</li>
<li>New hotels in new town. I bet they have heat and running water and power all year round.</li>

<li>Yak butter tea. Yak snacks (aka jerky).</li>
<li>Tibetan dinner. Creaky wooden restaurant. Cold, only space-heaters. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643084959/in/set-72157626364130939">Yak SASHIMI</a>, square noodle soup, meat pie (ground yak).</li>

<li>Oh, and the power outage? That means no heated blankets in our not-heated room tonight.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/6 Zhongdian, Tiger Leaping Gorge</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, the blankets were quite effective, probably yak wool.</li>
<li>Bus to Tiger Leaping Gorge.</li>
<li>The hike starts with a nice meandering valley stroll, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613131779/in/set-72157626364149741/">nice views</a>.</li>
<li>Followed by "24 bends", a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613693186/in/set-72157626364149741/">long series of switchbacks</a>.</li>
<li>"I smell weed. Or poop." - Shiloh. It was an old man with grandson in lap, smoking weed out of a long skinny pipe.</li>
<li>Ladies along the trail <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613107815/in/set-72157626364149741/">selling bags of weed, saffron and snickers</a>.</li>
<li>7 hours of hiking. Beautiful, amazing views every 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Got to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616869468/in/set-72157626364149741">Halfway House guesthouse</a>. Sat on the deck, had a beer and checked out the view.</li>
<li>Alek has a Chinese name: "Overcoming the power of mugwort". He's looking for a new one.</li>
<li>Dinner: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613714688/in/set-72157626364149741/">two mushroom dishes, eggplant, gung pao</a>. Damn.</li>
<li>Alek went into the kitchen and found their house-infused baijiao. One was mushroom. Yes, mushroom liquor. The other was olive, papaya, goji berry... and other stuff. Both were surprisingly good.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613138331/in/set-72157626364149741/">Closed it out</a> with biajiao, beer, tea, cards and Snickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/7 Tiger Leaping Gorge to Lijiang</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning hike out, about 3 hours.</li>
<li>Tina's Guesthouse is on the road. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616958512/in/set-72157626364149741/">Awesome roll-out menu</a>, with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616374961/in/set-72157626364149741">qmelettes</a>.</li>
<li>Had breakfast of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616375967/in/set-72157626364149741">Shanghai porridge</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616961466/in/set-72157626364149741">noodle soup</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616960152/in/set-72157626364149741">apple pie</a> (more like an empanada).</li>
<li>Alek took a bus out to the main highway to meet his friend, meeting us in Dali in few days.</li>
<li>Shiloh's feet hurt, so she camped out at Tina's.</li>
<li>We hiked the down a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616405899/in/set-72157626364149741">scary steep</a> "trail" (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616396047/in/set-72157626364149741">which would you choose?</a>) into the bottom of the gorge. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616435125/in/set-72157626364149741/">Epic nature</a>.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5617121608/in/set-72157626364149741/">We look happy</a> because we haven't started hiking back up yet. Well, we can't say we <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616459875/in/set-72157626364149741/">weren't warmed</a>. Too bad it's not high-season, or some old women could've carried us up safely <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5617047276/in/set-72157626364149741/">on one of these</a>.</li>
<li>Back up to the top. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616463551/in/set-72157626364149741/">Yeah, the gorge is amazing</a>.</li>
<li>We took a cab to the highway... Alek is there! His bus never came, so he's coming with us Lijiang.</li>
<li>AWESOME techno remixes of western pop songs the WHOLE way to Lijiang. I sat in front, so had the best view of the 94 times <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618613199/in/set-72157626372735607/">we almost died in head-on collisions</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618575139/in/set-72157626372735607/">The scenery was all rice terraces</a>. Wow.</li>
<li>Got into Lijiang. It's like an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618927727/in/set-72157626372735607/">old Chinese town</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619525266/in/set-72157626372735607/">Taken over by Disney</a>.</li>
<li>Checked-in at the guesthouse. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618949691/in/set-72157626372735607/">Wonderful decor</a>.</li>
<li>There's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619516550/in/set-72157626372735607/">ba ba</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619004317/in/set-72157626372735607/">Yak jerky</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619517478/in/set-72157626372735607/">Yak yogurt</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618992733/in/set-72157626372735607/">Lots of tea</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619522044/in/set-72157626372735607/">Dessert</a>.</li>
<li>Alek took us to a real Nakhi restaurant for dinner. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619505950/in/set-72157626372735607/">Huge store of cured pork</a>. We drank some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618919475/in/set-72157626372735607/">WFSM beer</a>, had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618920263/in/set-72157626372735607/">wild mushrooms</a>, some fungus called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618921041/in/set-72157626372735607/">"frog skin"</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618922897/in/set-72157626372735607/">everything soup</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618924617/in/set-72157626372735607/">the pork</a>. And more baijao. Did I say I loved China yet?</li>
<li>Back to the guesthouse, had some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619531936/in/set-72157626372735607/">bad wine</a> on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618948063/in/set-72157626372735607/">balcony overlooking the city</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/8 Lijiang, Dali</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619540296/in/set-72157626372735607/">Nakhi omelet</a> and, yep, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618951303/in/set-72157626372735607/">noodle soup</a>.</li>
<li>Before leaving town, went to Black Dragon Pool. Garden, with a pond that reflects Jade Emerald Mountain. Touristy. But <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619586032/in/set-72157626372735607/">nice picture op</a>.</li>
<li>Lunch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619576950/in/set-72157626372735607/">green beans and fermented bean sauce</a>, the song er mushrooms (song rong?), and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618989793/in/set-72157626372735607/">knife-cut noodles</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619587356/in/set-72157626372735607/">We saw Mao</a>.</li>
<li>Dali bus was 5 hours long. Longer than we expected. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620903140/in/set-72157626377062379">Great</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620310953/in/set-72157626377062379">drive</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620899162/in/set-72157626377062379">though</a>. Except for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643657534/in/set-72157626377062379">nasty cat on a leash</a>.</li>
<li>Checked into a guesthouse, and headed into old-town for dinner. Old-town is huge, and touristy, but way cooler than Lijiang. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620319979/in/set-72157626377062379">Castles, yo</a>.</li>
<li>In Dali, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620905810/in/set-72157626377062379">all the food in a restaurant is kept out front</a>, as advertisement. And <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620318877/in/set-72157626377062379">mushrooms!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620320763/in/set-72157626377062379">More skewers, beer and biajiao</a>.</li>
<li>Went for dessert. Heart shaped chocolate cake... on lettuce. Chocolate parfait... with a cherry tomato. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643095799/in/set-72157626377062379">Apple pie, that was a flavorless apple empanada... on lettuce... with strawberry ice cream</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/9 - Dali</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast of bao, black boiled eggs, baba stuffed with carmel sauce.</li>
<li>Alec's out, back to Thailand. All three words of Chinese we know will now be put to the test.</li>
<li>Somehow it's lunch already. Asparagus, tofu, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620910200/in/set-72157626377062379">emperor oyster mushrooms with dry-cured ham</a>.</li>
<li>Taxi to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620341691/in/set-72157626377062379">the cable car</a>. Hike from cable car to chairlift is too long, canceling that. Saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620400239/in/set-72157626377062379">a giant chess set</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621007478/in/set-72157626377062379">a mirror pond</a>.</li>
<li>Taxi to the chairlift that we didn't hike to. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621012994/in/set-72157626377062379">Beautiful ride</a>. Look down, oh a grave. Oh look, some more. OHHHHH, thousands of them. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621014814/in/set-72157626377062379">Chairlift mountain forest graveyard</a>.</li>
<li>At the top, we hike to the Higherland Inn, only thousands of steep steps up the mountain. Zero view. WTF. Head back down the trail to the restaurant with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621023462/in/set-72157626377062379">great view</a>. The place has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621020410/in/set-72157626377062379">turtles in a tub</a>... adjacent to all the food that's on the menu. Hmmm.</li>
<li>I got some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620433931/in/set-72157626377062379">wild mushrooms</a>. Instructions: soak 3 hours, scramble with egg.</li>
<li>Did some shopping in the old city, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620443393/in/set-72157626377062379">got some pasta</a>, and headed back to the hotel to chill.</li>
<li>Watched a kung fu movie with lots of flying. Saw a commercial for cleavage pills.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/10 Dali</p>
<ul>
<li>Banana pancakes and fresh melon for breakfast. Off to Xishuang for cormorant fishing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620449007/in/set-72157626377062379">Local market</a>. Saw an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621039100/in/set-72157626377062379">awesome computer store</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620470009/in/set-72157626377062379">Had noodles</a> that were cut off a giant slab that looked like butter. Found the spice they put on the skewers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620516951/in/set-72157626377062379">Cormorant</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620520205/in/set-72157626377062379/">fishing</a>! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620521725/in/set-72157626377062379">Rowed</a>. Sang songs.</li>
<li>On the way back, taxi driver took us to the obligatory kickback stop, a marble shop. The Chinese word for marble is "stone from Dali".</li>
<li>Shiloh chilled at the hotel while <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620528969/in/set-72157626377062379/">we rode bikes to the lake</a>. Stopped at a bakery where they had a "selection of mini sandwiches" on the menu. Turns out the mini sandwiches meant "all sandwiches on the menu, put into one". Fail.</li>
<li>Before dinner, got a foot massage, where they had us put our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620534137/in/set-72157626377062379">feet in BOILING water</a>.</li>
<li>Shiloh got a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620534623/in/set-72157626377062379">foot steam bath</a>. Shauna: "OK I can smell foot. It smells like a funk dumpling."</li>
<li>Saw some locals <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621119074/in/set-72157626377062379">smokin' tough</a>.</li>
<li>Hunted down the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621124012/in/set-72157626377062379/">wild grilled eggplant for dinner</a> again.</li>
</ul>
<p>4/11 Back to Kunming</p>
<ul>
<li>Bus to Kunming. Buses here are cheap, and constantly running. Gotta keep your valuables with you. And there's no bus stops, just people waiting on the side of the highway.</li>
<li>Another 5 hours on the road. We passed through <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621127772/in/set-72157626377062379">Mushroom</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621128704/in/set-72157626377062379">Town</a>. And went through multi-mile long tunnels.</li>
<li>Waited a couple of uneventful hours at the airport, spent our last yuan on tea, and flew home.</li>
